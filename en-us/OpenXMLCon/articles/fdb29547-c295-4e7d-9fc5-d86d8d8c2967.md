To use the sample code in this topic, you must install the  [Open XML SDK 2.0](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=5124). You must explicitly reference the following assemblies in your project:


- WindowsBase


- DocumentFormat.OpenXml (installed by the Open XML SDK)



You must also use the following  **using** directives or **Imports** statements to compile the code in this topic.


```C#
using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Office.CustomUI;
using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging;
```




```VB.net
Imports DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Office.CustomUI
Imports DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging
```

## Creating Custom UI
Before using the Open XML SDK 2.5 to create a ribbon customization in an Excel workbook, you must first create the customization content. Describing the XML required to create a ribbon customization is beyond the scope of this topic. In addition, you will find it far easier to use the Ribbon Designer in Visual Studio 2010 to create the customization for you. For more information about customizing the ribbon by using the Visual Studio Ribbon Designer, see  [Ribbon Designer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/26617206-f4da-416f-a18a-d817b2d4872d(Office.15).aspx) and [Walkthrough: Creating a Custom Tab by Using the Ribbon Designer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/312865e6-950f-46ab-88de-fe7eb8036bfe(Office.15).aspx). For the purposes of this demonstration, you will need an XML file that contains a customization, and the following code provides a simple customization (or you can create your own by using the Visual Studio Ribbon Designer, and then right-click to export the customization to an XML file). Copy the following content into a text file that is named AddCustomUI.xml for use as part of this example. This XML content describes a ribbon customization that includes a button labeled "Click Me!" in a group named Group1 on the Add-Ins tab in Excel. When you click the button, it attempts to run a macro named **SampleMacro** in the host workbook.


```XML
<customUI xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/2006/01/customui">
    <ribbon>
        <tabs>
            <tab idMso="TabAddIns">
                <group id="Group1" label="Group1">
                    <button id="Button1" label="Click Me!" showImage="false" onAction="SampleMacro"/>
                </group>
            </tab>
        </tabs>
    </ribbon>
</customUI>
```



<a name="sectionSection1" />




## Create the Macro
For this demonstration, the ribbon customization includes a button that attempts to run a macro in the host workbook. To complete the demonstration, you must create a macro in a sample workbook for the button's Click action to call. 


### To create the macro

1. Create a new workbook.



2. Press Alt+F11 to open the Visual Basic Editor.



3. On the Insert tab, clickModule to create a new module.



4. Add code such as the following to the new module.


```
Sub SampleMacro(button As IRibbonControl)
    MsgBox "You Clicked?"
End Sub
```





5. Save the workbook as an Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook named AddCustomUI.xlsm.






<a name="sectionSection2" />




## AddCustomUI Method
The  **AddCustomUI** method accepts two parameters:


- filename—A string that contains a file name that specifies the workbook to modify.


- customUIContent—A string that contains the custom content (that is, the XML markup that describes the customization).



The following code shows the two parameters.


```C#
static public void AddCustomUI(string fileName, string customUIContent)
```




```VB.net
Public Sub XLAddCustomUI(ByVal fileName As String,
                             ByVal customUIContent As String)
```



<a name="sectionSection3" />




## Calling the AddCustomUI Method
The method modifies the ribbon in an Excel workbook. To call the method, pass the file name of the workbook to modify, and a string that contains the customization XML, as shown in the following example code.


```C#
const string SAMPLEXML = "AddCustomUI.xml";
const string DEMOFILE = "AddCustomUI.xlsm";

string content = System.IO.File.OpenText(SAMPLEXML).ReadToEnd();
AddCustomUI(DEMOFILE, content);
```




```VB.net
Const SAMPLEXML As String = "AddCustomUI.xml"
Const DEMOFILE As String = "AddCustomUI.xlsm"

Dim content As String = System.IO.File.OpenText(SAMPLEXML).ReadToEnd()
AddCustomUI(DEMOFILE, content)
```



<a name="sectionSection4" />




## Interacting with the Workbook
The sample method,  **AddCustomUI**, starts by opening the requested workbook in read/write mode, as shown in the following code.


```C#
using (SpreadsheetDocument document = 
    SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, true))
```




```VB.net
Using document As SpreadsheetDocument =
    SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, True)
```



<a name="sectionSection5" />




## Work with the Ribbon Extensibility Part
Next, as shown in the following code, the sample method attempts to retrieve a reference to the single ribbon extensibility part. If the part does not yet exist, the code creates it and stores a reference to the new part. 


```C#
// You can have only a single ribbon extensibility part.
// If the part doesn't exist, create it.
var part = document.RibbonExtensibilityPart;
if (part == null)
{
    part = document.AddRibbonExtensibilityPart();
}
```




```VB.net
' You can have only a single ribbon extensibility part.
' If the part doesn't exist, add it.
Dim part = document.RibbonExtensibilityPart
If part Is Nothing Then
    part = document.AddRibbonExtensibilityPart
End If
```



<a name="sectionSection6" />




## Add the Customization
Given a reference to the ribbon extensibility part, the following code finishes by setting the part's **CustomUI** property to a new **CustomUI** object that contains the supplied customization. Once the customization is in place, the code saves the custom UI.


```C#
part.CustomUI = new CustomUI(customUIContent);
part.CustomUI.Save();
```




```VB.net
part.CustomUI = New CustomUI(customUIContent)
part.CustomUI.Save()
```



<a name="sectionSection7" />




## Sample Code
The following is the complete  **AddCustomUI** code sample in C# and Visual Basic.


```C#
static public void AddCustomUI(string fileName, string customUIContent)
{
    // Add a custom UI part to the document.
    // Use this sample XML to test:
    //<customUI xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/2006/01/customui">
    //    <ribbon>
    //        <tabs>
    //            <tab idMso="TabAddIns">
    //                <group id="Group1" label="Group1">
    //                    <button id="Button1" label="Button1" 
    //                    showImage="false" onAction="SampleMacro"/>
    //                </group>
    //            </tab>
    //        </tabs>
    //    </ribbon>
    //</customUI>

    // In the sample XLSM file, create a module and create a procedure
    // named SampleMacro, using this 
    // signature: Public Sub SampleMacro(control As IRibbonControl)
    // Add some code, and then save and close the XLSM file. Run this
    // example to add a button to the Add-Ins tab that calls the macro,
    // given the XML content above in the AddCustomUI.xml file.

    using (SpreadsheetDocument document = 
        SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, true))
    {
        // You can have only a single ribbon extensibility part.
        // If the part doesn't exist, create it.
        var part = document.RibbonExtensibilityPart;
        if (part == null)
        {
            part = document.AddRibbonExtensibilityPart();
        }
        part.CustomUI = new CustomUI(customUIContent);
        part.CustomUI.Save();
    }
}
```




```VB.net
Public Sub XLAddCustomUI(ByVal fileName As String,
                         ByVal customUIContent As String)
    ' Add a custom UI part to the document.
    ' Use this sample XML to test:

    '<customUI xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/2006/01/customui">
    '    <ribbon>
    '        <tabs>
    '            <tab idMso="TabAddIns">
    '                <group id="Group1" label="Group1">
    '                    <button id="Button1" label="Button1" 
    '                     showImage="false" onAction="SampleMacro"/>
    '                </group>
    '            </tab>
    '        </tabs>
    '    </ribbon>
    '</customUI>

    ' In the sample XLSM file, create a module and create a procedure 
    ' named SampleMacro, using this signature:
    ' Public Sub SampleMacro(control As IRibbonControl)
    ' Add some code, and then save and close the XLSM file. Run this
    ' example to add a button to the Add-Ins tab that calls the macro, 
    ' given the XML content above in the AddCustomUI.xml file.

    Using document As SpreadsheetDocument =
        SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, True)
        ' You can have only a single ribbon extensibility part.
        ' If the part doesn't exist, add it.
        Dim part = document.RibbonExtensibilityPart
        If part Is Nothing Then
            part = document.AddRibbonExtensibilityPart
        End If
        part.CustomUI = New CustomUI(customUIContent)
        part.CustomUI.Save()
    End Using
End Sub

```

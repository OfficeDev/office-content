# Open XML SDK 2.5 for Office design considerations
**Last modified:** July 25, 2012

_**Applies to:** Office 2013 | Open XML_

Before using the Open XML SDK 2.5 for Office, be aware of the following design considerations.


## Design Considerations
The Open XML SDK 2.5:


- Does not replace the Microsoft Office Object Model and provides no abstraction on top of the file formats. You must still understand the structure of the file formats to use the Open XML SDK 2.5.


- Does not provide functionality to convert Open XML formats to and from other formats, such as HTML or XPS.


- Does not guarantee document validity of Open XML Formats when you use the Open XML SDK 2.5 or if you decide to manipulate the underlying XML directly.


- Does not provide application behavior such as layout functionality in Word or recalculation, data refresh, or adjustment functionalities in Excel.

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK 2.5 for Office to open a spreadsheet document from a stream programmatically.

The following assembly directives are required to compile the code in this topic.


```C#
using System.IO;
using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging;
using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet;
using System.Linq;

```




```VB.net
Imports System.IO
Imports DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging
Imports DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet
Imports System.Linq

```

## When to Open From a Stream
If you have an application, such as Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010, that works with documents by using stream input/output, and you want to use the Open XML SDK 2.5 to work with one of the documents, this is designed to be easy to do. This is especially true if the document exists and you can open it using the Open XML SDK 2.5. However, suppose that the document is an open stream at the point in your code where you must use the SDK to work with it? That is the scenario for this topic. The sample method in the sample code accepts an open stream as a parameter and then adds text to the document behind the stream using the Open XML SDK 2.5.

## Getting a SpreadsheetDocument Object
In the Open XML SDK, the  **SpreadsheetDocument** class represents an Excel document package. To open and work with an Excel document, you create an instance of the **SpreadsheetDocument** class from the document. After you create the instance from the document, you can then obtain access to the main workbook part that contains the worksheets. The text in the document is represented in the package as XML using SpreadsheetML markup.

To create the class instance from the document, you call one of the  **Open()** methods. Several are provided, each with a different signature. The sample code in this topic uses the **Open(String, Boolean)** method with a signature that requires two parameters. The first parameter takes a full path string that represents the document that you want to open. The second parameter is either **true** or **false** and represents whether you want the file to be opened for editing. Any changes that you make to the document will not be saved if this parameter is **false**.

The code that calls the  **Open** method is shown in the following example.


```C#
// Open the document for editing.
using (SpreadsheetDocument document = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(docName, true))
```




```VB.net
' Open the document for editing.
Using document As SpreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(docName, True)
```



After you have opened the spreadsheet document package, you can add a row to a sheet in the workbook. Each workbook has a workbook part and at least one  **Worksheet**. To access the  **Workbook** assign a reference to the existing document body, represented by the **WorkbookPart**, as shown in the following code example.


```C#
WorkbookPart wbPart = document.WorkbookPart;
```




```VB.net
Dim wbPart As WorkbookPart = document.WorkbookPart
```



The basic document structure of a SpreadsheetML document consists of the  **Sheets** and **Sheet** elements, which reference the worksheets in the workbook. A separate XML file is created for each worksheet. For example, the SpreadsheetML for a workbook that has two worksheets name MySheet1 and MySheet2 is located in the Workbook.xml file and is shown in the following code example.


```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes" ?> 
<workbook xmlns=http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main xmlns:r="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships">
    <sheets>
        <sheet name="MySheet1" sheetId="1" r:id="rId1" /> 
        <sheet name="MySheet2" sheetId="2" r:id="rId2" /> 
    </sheets>
</workbook>

```



The worksheet XML files contain one or more block level elements such as  **SheetData**.  **sheetData** represents the cell table and contains one or more **Row** elements. A **row** contains one or more **Cell** elements. Each cell contains a **CellValue** element that represents the value of the cell. For example, the **SpreadsheetML** for the first worksheet in a workbook, that only has the value 100 in cell A1, is located in the Sheet1.xml file and is shown in the following code example.


```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?> 
<worksheet xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main">
    <sheetData>
        <row r="1">
            <c r="A1">
                <v>100</v> 
            </c>
        </row>
    </sheetData>
</worksheet>
```



Using the Open XML SDK 2.5, you can create document structure and content that uses strongly-typed classes that correspond to SpreadsheetML elements. You can find these classes in the  **DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet** namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the **workbook**,  **sheets**,  **sheet**,  **worksheet**, and  **sheetData** elements.

## Generating the SpreadsheetML Markup to Add a Worksheet
When you have access to the body of the main document part, you add a worksheet by calling  **AddNewPart<T>(String, String)** method to create a new **WorksheetPart**. The following code example adds the new  **WorksheetPart**.


```C#
// Add a new worksheet.
WorksheetPart newWorksheetPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.AddNewPart<WorksheetPart>();
newWorksheetPart.Worksheet = new Worksheet(new SheetData());
newWorksheetPart.Worksheet.Save();
```




```VB.net
' Add a new worksheet.
Dim newWorksheetPart As WorksheetPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.AddNewPart(Of WorksheetPart)()
newWorksheetPart.Worksheet = New Worksheet(New SheetData())
newWorksheetPart.Worksheet.Save()
```



<a name="sectionSection4" />




## Sample Code
In this example, the  **OpenAndAddToSpreadsheetStream** method can be used to open a spreadsheet document from an already open stream and append some text to it. In your program, you can use the following example to call the **OpenAndAddToSpreadsheetStream** method that uses a file named Sheet11.xslx.


```C#
string strDoc = @"C:\Users\Public\Documents\Sheet11.xlsx";
Stream stream = File.Open(strDoc, FileMode.Open);
OpenAndAddToSpreadsheetStream(stream);
stream.Close();
```




```VB.net
Dim strDoc As String = "C:\Users\Public\Documents\Sheet11.xlsx"
Dim stream As Stream = File.Open(strDoc, FileMode.Open)
OpenAndAddToSpreadsheetStream(stream)
stream.Close()
```



Notice that the  **OpenAddAndAddToSpreadsheetStream** method does not close the stream passed to it. The calling code must do that.

The following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.


```C#
public static void OpenAndAddToSpreadsheetStream(Stream stream)
{
    // Open a SpreadsheetDocument based on a stream.
    SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument =
        SpreadsheetDocument.Open(stream, true);

    // Add a new worksheet.
    WorksheetPart newWorksheetPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.AddNewPart<WorksheetPart>();
    newWorksheetPart.Worksheet = new Worksheet(new SheetData());
    newWorksheetPart.Worksheet.Save();

    Sheets sheets = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.Workbook.GetFirstChild<Sheets>();
    string relationshipId = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.GetIdOfPart(newWorksheetPart);

    // Get a unique ID for the new worksheet.
    uint sheetId = 1;
    if (sheets.Elements<Sheet>().Count() > 0)
    {
        sheetId = sheets.Elements<Sheet>().Select(s => s.SheetId.Value).Max() + 1;
    }

    // Give the new worksheet a name.
    string sheetName = "Sheet" + sheetId;

    // Append the new worksheet and associate it with the workbook.
    Sheet sheet = new Sheet() { Id = relationshipId, SheetId = sheetId, Name = sheetName };
    sheets.Append(sheet);
    spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.Workbook.Save();

    // Close the document handle.
    spreadsheetDocument.Close();

    // Caller must close the stream.
}

```




```VB.net
Public Sub OpenAndAddToSpreadsheetStream(ByVal stream As Stream)
    ' Open a SpreadsheetDocument based on a stream.
    Dim mySpreadsheetDocument As SpreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(stream, True)

    ' Add a new worksheet.
    Dim newWorksheetPart As WorksheetPart = mySpreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.AddNewPart(Of WorksheetPart)()
    newWorksheetPart.Worksheet = New Worksheet(New SheetData())
    newWorksheetPart.Worksheet.Save()

    Dim sheets As Sheets = mySpreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.Workbook.GetFirstChild(Of Sheets)()
    Dim relationshipId As String = mySpreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.GetIdOfPart(newWorksheetPart)

    ' Get a unique ID for the new worksheet.
    Dim sheetId As UInteger = 1
    If (sheets.Elements(Of Sheet).Count > 0) Then
        sheetId = sheets.Elements(Of Sheet).Select(Function(s) s.SheetId.Value).Max + 1
    End If

    ' Give the new worksheet a name.
    Dim sheetName As String = ("Sheet" + sheetId.ToString())

    ' Append the new worksheet and associate it with the workbook.
    Dim sheet As Sheet = New Sheet
    sheet.Id = relationshipId
    sheet.SheetId = sheetId
    sheet.Name = sheetName
    sheets.Append(sheet)
    mySpreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.Workbook.Save()

    'Close the document handle.
    mySpreadsheetDocument.Close()

    'Caller must close the stream.
End Sub
```

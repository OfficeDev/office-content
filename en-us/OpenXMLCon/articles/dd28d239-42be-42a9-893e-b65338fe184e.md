This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK 2.5 for Office to programmatically read a large Excel file. For more information about the basic structure of a  **SpreadsheetML** document, see [Structure of a SpreadsheetML document (Open XML SDK)](3b35a153-c8ff-4dc7-96d5-02c515f31770.md).

You must use the following  **using** directives or **Imports** statements to compile the code in this topic.


```C#
using System;
using System.Linq;
using DocumentFormat.OpenXml;
using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging;
using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet;

```




```VisualBasic
Imports System
Imports System.Linq
Imports DocumentFormat.OpenXml
Imports DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging
Imports DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet

```

## Getting a SpreadsheetDocument Object
In the Open XML SDK, the  **SpreadsheetDocument** class represents an Excel document package. To open and work with an Excel document, you create an instance of the **SpreadsheetDocument** class from the document. After you create this instance, you can use it to obtain access to the main workbook part that contains the worksheets. The content in the document is represented in the package as XML using **SpreadsheetML** markup.

To create the class instance, you call one of the overloads of the  **Open()** method. The following code sample shows how to use the **Open(String, Boolean)** overload. The first parameter takes a string that represents the full path to the document to open. The second parameter takes a value of **true** or **false** and represents whether or not you want the file to be opened for editing. In this example, the parameter is **false** because the document is opened as read-only.


```C#
// Open the document for editing.
using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = 
    SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, false))
{
    // Code removed here.
}
```




```VisualBasic
' Open the document for editing.
Using spreadsheetDocument As SpreadsheetDocument = _
SpreadsheetDocument.Open(filename, False)
    ' Code removed here.
End Using
```

## Approaches to Parsing Open XML Files
The Open XML SDK provides two approaches to parsing Open XML files. You can use the SDK Document Object Model (DOM), or the Simple API for XML (SAX) reading and writing features. The SDK DOM is designed to make it easy to query and parse Open XML files by using strongly-typed classes. However, the DOM approach requires loading entire Open XML parts into memory, which can cause an Out of Memory exception when you are working with really large files. Using the SAX approach, you can employ an OpenXMLReader to read the XML in the file one element at a time, without having to load the entire file into memory. Consider using SAX when you need to handle very large files.

The following code segment is used to read a very large Excel file using the DOM approach.


```C#
WorkbookPart workbookPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart;
WorksheetPart worksheetPart = workbookPart.WorksheetParts.First();
SheetData sheetData = worksheetPart.Worksheet.Elements<SheetData>().First();
string text;
foreach (Row r in sheetData.Elements<Row>())
{
    foreach (Cell c in r.Elements<Cell>())
    {
        text = c.CellValue.Text;
        Console.Write(text + " ");
    }
}
```




```VisualBasic
Dim workbookPart As WorkbookPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart
Dim worksheetPart As WorksheetPart = workbookPart.WorksheetParts.First()
Dim sheetData As SheetData = worksheetPart.Worksheet.Elements(Of SheetData)().First()
Dim text As String
For Each r As Row In sheetData.Elements(Of Row)()
    For Each c As Cell In r.Elements(Of Cell)()
        text = c.CellValue.Text
        Console.Write(text &amp; " ")
    Next
Next
```



The following code segment performs an identical task to the preceding sample (reading a very large Excel file), but uses the SAX approach. This is the recommended approach for reading very large files.


```C#
WorkbookPart workbookPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart;
WorksheetPart worksheetPart = workbookPart.WorksheetParts.First();

OpenXmlReader reader = OpenXmlReader.Create(worksheetPart);
string text;
while (reader.Read())
{
    if (reader.ElementType == typeof(CellValue))
    {
        text = reader.GetText();
        Console.Write(text + " ");
    }
}
```




```VisualBasic
Dim workbookPart As WorkbookPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart
Dim worksheetPart As WorksheetPart = workbookPart.WorksheetParts.First()

Dim reader As OpenXmlReader = OpenXmlReader.Create(worksheetPart)
Dim text As String
While reader.Read()
    If reader.ElementType = GetType(CellValue) Then
        text = reader.GetText()
        Console.Write(text &amp; " ")
    End If
End While
```

## Sample Code
You can imagine a scenario where you work for a financial company that handles very large Excel spreadsheets. Those spreadsheets are updated daily by analysts and can easily grow to sizes exceeding hundreds of megabytes. You need a solution to read and extract relevant data from every spreadsheet. The following code example contains two methods that correspond to the two approaches, DOM and SAX. The latter technique will avoid memory exceptions when using very large files. To try them, you can call them in your code one after the other or you can call each method separately by commenting the call to the one you would like to exclude.


```C#
String fileName = @"C:\Users\Public\Documents\BigFile.xlsx";
// Comment one of the following lines to test the method separately.
ReadExcelFileDOM(fileName);    // DOM
ReadExcelFileSAX(fileName);    // SAX

```




```VisualBasic
Dim fileName As String = "C:\Users\Public\Documents\BigFile.xlsx"
' Comment one of the following lines to test each method separately.
ReadExcelFileDOM(fileName)    ' DOM
ReadExcelFileSAX(fileName)    ' SAX

```



The following is the complete code sample in both C# and Visual Basic.


```C#
// The DOM approach.
// Note that the code below works only for cells that contain numeric values.
// 
static void ReadExcelFileDOM(string fileName)
{
    using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, false))
    {
        WorkbookPart workbookPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart;
        WorksheetPart worksheetPart = workbookPart.WorksheetParts.First();
        SheetData sheetData = worksheetPart.Worksheet.Elements<SheetData>().First();
        string text;
        foreach (Row r in sheetData.Elements<Row>())
        {
            foreach (Cell c in r.Elements<Cell>())
            {
                text = c.CellValue.Text;
                Console.Write(text + " ");
            }
        }
        Console.WriteLine();
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}

// The SAX approach.
static void ReadExcelFileSAX(string fileName)
{
    using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, false))
    {
        WorkbookPart workbookPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart;
        WorksheetPart worksheetPart = workbookPart.WorksheetParts.First();

        OpenXmlReader reader = OpenXmlReader.Create(worksheetPart);
        string text;
        while (reader.Read())
        {
            if (reader.ElementType == typeof(CellValue))
            {
                text = reader.GetText();
                Console.Write(text + " ");
            }
        }
        Console.WriteLine();
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}


```




```VisualBasic
' The DOM approach.
' Note that the this code works only for cells that contain numeric values.


Private Sub ReadExcelFileDOM(ByVal fileName As String)
    Using spreadsheetDocument As SpreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, False)
        Dim workbookPart As WorkbookPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart
        Dim worksheetPart As WorksheetPart = workbookPart.WorksheetParts.First()
        Dim sheetData As SheetData = worksheetPart.Worksheet.Elements(Of SheetData)().First()
        Dim text As String
        For Each r As Row In sheetData.Elements(Of Row)()
            For Each c As Cell In r.Elements(Of Cell)()
                text = c.CellValue.Text
                Console.Write(text &amp; " ")
            Next
        Next
        Console.WriteLine()
        Console.ReadKey()
    End Using
End Sub

' The SAX approach.
Private Sub ReadExcelFileSAX(ByVal fileName As String)
    Using spreadsheetDocument As SpreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, False)
        Dim workbookPart As WorkbookPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart
        Dim worksheetPart As WorksheetPart = workbookPart.WorksheetParts.First()

        Dim reader As OpenXmlReader = OpenXmlReader.Create(worksheetPart)
        Dim text As String
        While reader.Read()
            If reader.ElementType = GetType(CellValue) Then
                text = reader.GetText()
                Console.Write(text &amp; " ")
            End If
        End While
        Console.WriteLine()
        Console.ReadKey()
    End Using
End Sub
```

This topic shows how to use the Open XML SDK 2.5 for Office to programmatically change text in a table in an existing word processing document.

The following assembly directives are required to compile the code in this topic.


```C#
using System.Linq;
using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging;
using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Wordprocessing;

```




```VisualBasic
Imports System.Linq
Imports DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging
Imports DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Wordprocessing
```

## Open the Existing Document
To open an existing document, instantiate the  **WordprocessingDocument** class as shown in the following **using** statement. In the same statement, open the word processing file at the specifiedfilepath by using the **Open** method, with the Boolean parameter set to **true** to enable editing the document.


```C#
using (WordprocessingDocument doc =
       WordprocessingDocument.Open(filepath, true)) 
{ 
   // Insert other code here. 
}

```




```VisualBasic
Using doc As WordprocessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(filepath, True)
   ' Insert other code here. 
End Using
```



The  **using** statement provides a recommended alternative to the typical .Open, .Save, .Close sequence. It ensures that the **Dispose** method (internal method used by the Open XML SDK to clean up resources) is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the **using** statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the **using** statement, in this casedoc. Because the  **WordprocessingDocument** class in the Open XML SDK automatically saves and closes the object as part of its **System.IDisposable** implementation, and because **Dispose** is automatically called when you exit the block, you do not have to explicitly call **Save** and **Close**-as long as you use  **using**.

## The Structure of a Table
The basic document structure of a  **WordProcessingML** document consists of the **document** and **body** elements, followed by one or more block level elements such as **p**, which represents a paragraph. A paragraph contains one or more  **r** elements. The **r** stands for run, which is a region of text with a common set of properties, such as formatting. A run contains one or more **t** elements. The **t** element contains a range of text.

The document might contain a table as in this example. A table is a set of paragraphs (and other block-level content) arranged inrows andcolumns. Tables in  **WordprocessingML** are defined via the **tbl** element, which is analogous to the HTML table tag. Consider an empty one-cell table (that is, a table with one row and one column) and 1 point borders on all sides. This table is represented by the following **WordprocessingML** code example.


```XML
<w:tbl>
  <w:tblPr>
    <w:tblW w:w="5000" w:type="pct"/>
    <w:tblBorders>
      <w:top w:val="single" w:sz="4" w:space="0" w:color="auto"/>
      <w:left w:val="single" w:sz="4 w:space="0" w:color="auto"/>
      <w:bottom w:val="single" w:sz="4" w:space="0" w:color="auto"/>
      <w:right w:val="single" w:sz="4" w:space="0" w:color="auto"/>
    </w:tblBorders>
  </w:tblPr>
  <w:tblGrid>
    <w:gridCol w:w="10296"/>
  </w:tblGrid>
  <w:tr>
    <w:tc>
      <w:tcPr>
        <w:tcW w:w="0" w:type="auto"/>
      </w:tcPr>
      <w:p/>
    </w:tc>
  </w:tr>
</w:tbl>
```



This table specifies table-wide properties of 100% of page width using the  **tblW** element, a set of table borders using the **tblBorders** element, the table grid, which defines a set of shared vertical edges within the table using the **tblGrid** element, and a single table row using the **tr** element.

## How the Sample Code Works
In the sample code, after you open the document in the  **using** statement, you locate the first table in the document. Then you locate the second row in the table by finding the row whose index is 1. Next, you locate the third cell in that row whose index is 2, as shown in the following code example.


```C#
// Find the first table in the document.
Table table =
    doc.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body.Elements<Table>().First();

// Find the second row in the table.
TableRow row = table.Elements<TableRow>().ElementAt(1);

// Find the third cell in the row.
TableCell cell = row.Elements<TableCell>().ElementAt(2);

```




```VisualBasic
' Find the first table in the document.
Dim table As Table = doc.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body.Elements(Of Table)().First()

' Find the second row in the table.
Dim row As TableRow = table.Elements(Of TableRow)().ElementAt(1)

' Find the third cell in the row.
Dim cell As TableCell = row.Elements(Of TableCell)().ElementAt(2)

```



After you have located the target cell, you locate the first run in the first paragraph of the cell and replace the text with the passed in text. The following code example shows these actions.


```C#
Paragraph p = cell.Elements<Paragraph>().First();
Run r = p.Elements<Run>().First();
Text t = r.Elements<Text>().First();
t.Text = txt;
```




```VisualBasic
Dim p As Paragraph = cell.Elements(Of Paragraph)().First()
Dim r As Run = p.Elements(Of Run)().First()
Dim t As Text = r.Elements(Of Text)().First()
t.Text = txt

```

## Change Text in a Cell in a Table
The following code example shows how to change the text in the specified table cell in a word processing document. The code example expects that the document, whose file name and path are passed as an argument to the  **ChangeTextInCell** method, contains a table. The code example also expects that the table has at least two rows and three columns, and that the table contains text in the cell that is located at the second row and the third column position. When you call the **ChangeTextInCell** method in your program, the text in the cell at the specified location will be replaced by the text that you pass in as the second argument to the **ChangeTextInCell** method. In the following table the text "The text from the API example" was used.


****

<table xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mtps="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/mtps" xmlns:mshelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" xmlns:ddue="http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"><tr><td><p>Some text</p></td><td><p>Some text</p></td><td><p>Some text</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Some text</p></td><td><p>Some text</p></td><td><p>The text from the API example</p></td></tr></table>
<a name="sectionSection5" />




## Sample Code
The  **ChangeTextinCell** method changes the text in the second row and the third column of the first table found in the file. You call it by passing a full path to the file as the first parameter, and the text to use as the second parameter. For example, the following call to the **ChangeTextInCell** method changes the text in the specified cell to "The text from the API example."


```C#
ChangeTextInCell(@"c:\Users\Public\Documents\word4.docx",
"The text from the API example");
```




```VisualBasic
ChangeTextInCell("C:\Users\Public\Documents\word4.docx", _
"The text from the API example")
```



Following is the complete code example.


```C#
// Change the text in a table in a word processing document.
public static void ChangeTextInCell(string filepath, string txt)
{
    // Use the file name and path passed in as an argument to 
    // open an existing document.            
    using (WordprocessingDocument doc =
        WordprocessingDocument.Open(filepath, true))
    {
        // Find the first table in the document.
        Table table =
            doc.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body.Elements<Table>().First();

        // Find the second row in the table.
        TableRow row = table.Elements<TableRow>().ElementAt(1);

        // Find the third cell in the row.
        TableCell cell = row.Elements<TableCell>().ElementAt(2);

        // Find the first paragraph in the table cell.
        Paragraph p = cell.Elements<Paragraph>().First();

        // Find the first run in the paragraph.
        Run r = p.Elements<Run>().First();

        // Set the text for the run.
        Text t = r.Elements<Text>().First();
        t.Text = txt;
    }
}
```




```VisualBasic
' Change the text in a table in a word processing document.
Public Sub ChangeTextInCell(ByVal filepath As String, ByVal txt As String)
    ' Use the file name and path passed in as an argument to 
    ' Open an existing document. 
    Using doc As WordprocessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(filepath, True)
        ' Find the first table in the document.
        Dim table As Table = doc.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body.Elements(Of Table)().First()
        
        ' Find the second row in the table.
        Dim row As TableRow = table.Elements(Of TableRow)().ElementAt(1)
        
        ' Find the third cell in the row.
        Dim cell As TableCell = row.Elements(Of TableCell)().ElementAt(2)
        
        ' Find the first paragraph in the table cell.
        Dim p As Paragraph = cell.Elements(Of Paragraph)().First()
        
        ' Find the first run in the paragraph.
        Dim r As Run = p.Elements(Of Run)().First()
        
        ' Set the text for the run.
        Dim t As Text = r.Elements(Of Text)().First()
        t.Text = txt
    End Using
End Sub
```

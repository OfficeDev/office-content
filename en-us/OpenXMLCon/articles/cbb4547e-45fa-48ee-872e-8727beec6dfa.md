This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK 2.5 for Office to programmatically search and replace a text value in a word processing document.

The following assembly directives are required to compile the code in this topic.


```C#
using System.IO;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;
using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging;

```




```VB.net
Imports System.IO
Imports System.Text.RegularExpressions
Imports DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging

```

## Packages and Document Parts
An Open XML document is stored as a package, whose format is defined by  [ISO/IEC 29500-2](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=194337). The package can have multiple parts with relationships between them. The relationship between parts controls the category of the document. A document can be defined as a word-processing document if its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a main document part. If its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a presentation part it can be defined as a presentation document. If its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a workbook part, it is defined as a spreadsheet document. In this how-to topic, you will use a word-processing document package.

## Getting a WordprocessingDocument Object
In the sample code, you start by opening the word processing file by instantiating the  **WordprocessingDocument** class as shown in the following **using** statement. In the same statement, you open the word processing file_document_ by using the **Open** method, with the Boolean parameter set to **true** to enable editing the document.


```C#
using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc = 
        WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, true))
{
    // Insert other code here.
}
```




```VB.net
Using wordDoc As WordprocessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, True)
    ' Insert other code here.
End Using
```



The  **using** statement provides a recommended alternative to the typical .Open, .Save, .Close sequence. It ensures that the **Dispose** method (internal method used by the Open XML SDK to clean up resources) is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the **using** statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the **using** statement, in this case_wordDoc_. Because the  **WordprocessingDocument** class in the Open XML SDK automatically saves and closes the object as part of its **System.IDisposable** implementation, and because **Dispose** is automatically called when you exit the block, you do not have to explicitly call **Save** and **Close**-as long as you use  **using**.

## How the Sample Code Works
After you have opened the file for editing, you read it by using a  **StreamReader** object.


```C#
using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(wordDoc.MainDocumentPart.GetStream()))
{
    docText = sr.ReadToEnd();
}

```




```VB.net
Dim sr As StreamReader = New StreamReader(wordDoc.MainDocumentPart.GetStream)

    using (sr)
        docText = sr.ReadToEnd
    End using

```



The code then creates a regular expression object that contains the string "Hello world!" It then replaces the text value with the text "Hi Everyone!." For more information about regular expressions, see  [Regular Expressions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hs600312.aspx)


```C#
Regex regexText = new Regex("Hello world!");
docText = regexText.Replace(docText, "Hi Everyone!");

```




```VB.net
Dim regexText As Regex = New Regex("Hello world!")
docText = regexText.Replace(docText, "Hi Everyone!")

```

## Sample Code
Note: The following example demonstrates a quick and easy way to search and replace. It may not be reliable because it retrieves the XML document in string format. Depending on the regular expression you might unintentially replace XML tags and corrupt the document. If you simply want to search a document, but not replace the contents you can use MainDocumentPart.Document.InnerText.

The following code example shows how to use a regular expression to search and replace the text value, "Hello world!" stored in a word processing file named "MyPkg8.docx," with the value "Hi Everyone!". To call the method  **SearchAndReplace**, you can use the following example.


```C#
SearchAndReplace(@"C:\Users\Public\Documents\MyPkg8.docx");

```




```VB.net
SearchAndReplace("C:\Users\Public\Documents\MyPkg8.docx")

```



After running the program, you can inspect the file to see the change in the text, "Hello world!"

The following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.


```C#
// To search and replace content in a document part.
public static void SearchAndReplace(string document)
{
    using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, true))
    {
        string docText = null;
        using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(wordDoc.MainDocumentPart.GetStream()))
        {
            docText = sr.ReadToEnd();
        }

        Regex regexText = new Regex("Hello world!");
        docText = regexText.Replace(docText, "Hi Everyone!");

        using (StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(wordDoc.MainDocumentPart.GetStream(FileMode.Create)))
        {
            sw.Write(docText);
        }
    }
}
```




```VB.net
' To search and replace content in a document part. 
Public Sub SearchAndReplace(ByVal document As String)
    Dim wordDoc As WordprocessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, True)
    using (wordDoc)
        Dim docText As String = Nothing
        Dim sr As StreamReader = New StreamReader(wordDoc.MainDocumentPart.GetStream)

        using (sr)
            docText = sr.ReadToEnd
        End using

        Dim regexText As Regex = New Regex("Hello world!")
        docText = regexText.Replace(docText, "Hi Everyone!")
        Dim sw As StreamWriter = New StreamWriter(wordDoc.MainDocumentPart.GetStream(FileMode.Create))

        using (sw)
            sw.Write(docText)
        End using
    End using
End Sub
```

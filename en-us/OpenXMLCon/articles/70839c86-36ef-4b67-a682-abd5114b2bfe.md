This topic describes how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK 2.5 for Office to programmatically retrieve the comments from the main document part in a word processing document.

The following assembly directives are required to compile the code in this topic.


```C#
using System;
using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging;
using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Wordprocessing;
```




```VisualBasic
Imports System
Imports DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging
Imports DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Wordprocessing
```

## Open the Existing Document for Read-only Access
To open an existing document, instantiate the  **WordprocessingDocument** class as shown in the following **using** statement. In the same statement, open the word processing file at the specifiedfileName by using the **Open(String, Boolean)** method. To open the file for editing the Boolean parameter is set to **true**. In this example you just need to read the file; therefore, you can open the file for read-only access by setting the Boolean parameter to  **false**.


```C#
using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc = 
       WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, false)) 
{ 
   // Insert other code here. 
}

```




```VisualBasic
Using wordDoc As WordprocessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, False)
    ' Insert other code here.
End Using

```



The  **using** statement provides a recommended alternative to the typical .Open, .Save, .Close sequence. It ensures that the **Dispose** method (internal method used by the Open XML SDK to clean up resources) is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the **using** statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the **using** statement, in this casewordDoc.

## Comments Element
The  **comments** and **comment** elements are crucial to working with comments in a word processing file. It is important in this code example to familiarize yourself with those elements.

The following information from the  [ISO/IEC 29500](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=194337) specification introduces the comments element.


> **comments (Comments Collection)**


> This element specifies all of the comments defined in the current document. It is the root element of the comments part of a WordprocessingML document.


> Consider the following WordprocessingML fragment for the content of a comments part in a WordprocessingML document:


```XML
<w:comments>
  <w:comment … >
    …
  </w:comment>
</w:comments>
```




> © ISO/IEC29500: 2008.

The following XML schema segment defines the contents of the comments element.


```XML
<complexType name="CT_Comments">
   <sequence>
       <element name="comment" type="CT_Comment" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
   </sequence>
</complexType>

```

## Comment Element
The following information from the  [ISO/IEC 29500](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=194337) specification introduces the comment element.


> **comment (Comment Content)**


> This element specifies the content of a single comment stored in the comments part of a WordprocessingML document.


> If a comment is not referenced by document content via a matching **id** attribute on a valid use of the**commentReference** element, then it may be ignored when loading the document. If more than one comment shares the same value for the**id** attribute, then only one comment shall be loaded and the others may be ignored.


> Consider a document with text with an annotated comment as follows:


![Document text with annotated comment]
(images/w-comment01.gif)


> This comment is represented by the following WordprocessingML fragment.


```XML
<w:comment w:id="1" w:initials="User">
  …
</w:comment>
```




> The **comment** element specifies the presence of a single comment within the comments part.


> © ISO/IEC29500: 2008.



The following XML schema segment defines the contents of the comment element.


```XML
<complexType name="CT_Comment">
   <complexContent>
       <extension base="CT_TrackChange">
          <sequence>
              <group ref="EG_BlockLevelElts" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
          </sequence>
          <attribute name="initials" type="ST_String" use="optional"/>
       </extension>
   </complexContent>
</complexType>
```

## How the Sample Code Works
After you have opened the file for read-only access, you instantiate the  **WordprocessingCommentsPart** class. You can then display the inner text of the **Comment** element.


```C#
foreach (Comment comment in commentsPart.Comments.Elements<Comment>())
{
    Console.WriteLine(comment.InnerText);
}
```




```VisualBasic
For Each comment As Comment In _
    commentsPart.Comments.Elements(Of Comment)()
    Console.WriteLine(comment.InnerText)
Next

```

## Sample Code
The following code example shows how to retrieve comments that have been inserted into a word processing document. To call the method  **GetCommentsFromDocument** you can use the following call, which retrieves comments from a file named "Word16.docx," as an example.


```C#
string fileName = @"C:\Users\Public\Documents\Word16.docx";
GetCommentsFromDocument(fileName);
```




```VisualBasic
Dim fileName As String = "C:\Users\Public\Documents\Word16.docx"
GetCommentsFromDocument(fileName)
```



The following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.


```C#
public static void GetCommentsFromDocument(string fileName)
{
    using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc = 
        WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, false))
    {
        WordprocessingCommentsPart commentsPart = 
            wordDoc.MainDocumentPart.WordprocessingCommentsPart;

        if (commentsPart != null &amp;&amp; commentsPart.Comments != null)
        {
            foreach (Comment comment in commentsPart.Comments.Elements<Comment>())
            {
                Console.WriteLine(comment.InnerText);
            }
        }
    }
}
```




```VisualBasic
Public Sub GetCommentsFromDocument(ByVal fileName As String)
    Using wordDoc As WordprocessingDocument = _
        WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, False)

        Dim commentsPart As WordprocessingCommentsPart = _
            wordDoc.MainDocumentPart.WordprocessingCommentsPart

        If commentsPart IsNot Nothing AndAlso _
            commentsPart.Comments IsNot Nothing Then
            For Each comment As Comment In _
                commentsPart.Comments.Elements(Of Comment)()
                Console.WriteLine(comment.InnerText)
            Next
        End If
    End Using
End Sub
```

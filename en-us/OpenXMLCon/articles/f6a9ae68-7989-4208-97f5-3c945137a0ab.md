# Welcome to the Open XML SDK 2.5 for Office
This content set provides documentation and guidance for the strongly-typed classes in the Open XML SDK 2.5 for Office.

**Last modified:** April 09, 2013

_**Applies to:** Office 2013 | Open XML_

The SDK is built on the  **System.IO.Packaging** API and provides strongly-typed classes to manipulate documents that adhere to the Office Open XML File Formats Specification. The Office Open XML File Formats specification is an open, international, [ECMA-376, Second Edition](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm) and [ISO/IEC 29500](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=51463) standard. The Open XML file formats are useful for developers because they are an open standard and are based on well-known technologies: ZIP and XML.

The Open XML SDK 2.5 simplifies the task of manipulating Open XML packages and the underlying Open XML schema elements within a package. The Open XML SDK 2.5 encapsulates many common tasks that developers perform on Open XML packages, so that you can perform complex operations with just a few lines of code.

Portions of ISO/IEC 29500:20081 are referenced in the SDK.
